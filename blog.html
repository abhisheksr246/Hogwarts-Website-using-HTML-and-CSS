                <h2>LORD VOLDEMORT DEFEATED!!!</h2>
                <p>Reports ifrom Hogwarts School of witchcraft and Wizardry have been confirmed to be true:
                    The Dark Lord He Who Must Not Be Named, Lord Voldemort has been defeated once and for all by Harry Potter.
                    
                    Seventeen year old potter had not been seen by members of the community since disappearance from his home on the thirtieth of july 1997. He, along with frineds Ron Weasly and Hermione Granger were also reported to be missing prsumably accompanying Potter. 
                    
                    Last night, Lord Voldemort and his Death Eater Army attacked Hogwarts, ruthlessly killing over fifty students, teachers and Ministry Officials. <br> 
                    Severus Snape, Headmaster of Hogwarts, was one of those caught in the attack. However, stories are as to whether Sanape was fighting against or alongside Lord Voldermort. The former Death Eater, Snape was a trusted accomplice to Albus Dumbledore, prvious headmaster. In the rarkaroff trial in 1981, Dumbledore was quoted as saying that "Severus Snape changed sodes befor the downfall of Lord Voldemort; I trust him with my life". 
                    
                    However with Hogwarts under the dictatorship of Voldemort since September, the introduction of Dark Arts classes and the use of unforgivable Curses on students at the school, nobody fully knows where priorities lied. 
                    
                    From hogmeade village, eyewitnesses claimed that they could hear the voice of voldemort talking to them inside their heads. Madame Rosmerta, landlady of the three broosticks, said that the Dark Lord spoke about "Harry Potter turning himself in and for people to dispose fo the dead with dignity". How Potter defeated Voldemort is still unknown, but sources indicate that the use of Disarming Spell caused voldemort's Killing Curse to backfire. Included in the battle of hogwarts was Neville Longbottom, who bravely destroyed the dark Lord's Vicious snake, Nagini. </p>
